Description: Simplify the process of making a GitHub release. There are three major features provided by 'tagbot'. 1. It performs 'diff' between the source file of a release and the package's git repo to decide which commit is corresponding to the release. 2. It generates a changelog of closed issues and merged pull requested from GitHub API. 3. It publishes a GitHub release with the changelog.
